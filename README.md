----------------
This is the repository for [Someguy123's Atom Builds Site](http://atom.someguy123.com)

The site was made in [Middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman) which is a Ruby static site generator. Please install it if you want to modify this site.

Builds are stored in the `builds.json` file, I generally use a small build script which outputs the JSON to go into this file. Once new builds are added, you need to run `middleman build` to create the static html, or `middleman` by itself just to do general testing of your code.
